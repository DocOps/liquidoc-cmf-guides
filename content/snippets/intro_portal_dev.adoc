This Developer's {guide_term} will get you started modifying and hopefully contributing back to LiquiDoc and the LiquiDoc Content Management Framework.

In this context, a _developer_ is someone who hacks the core tooling of a docs project, whether in coordination with the core LD team or on their own, as anyone is welcome todo.
We hope you find these docs helpful.

If your job is to _implement_, _configure_, or _design_ a content project _using_ LiquiDoc or LDCMF, this is probably not the guide for you.
Those tasks are associated with the *administrator* roll.

If you are contributing to a product's documentation as a developer, you almost certainly want the Contributor's {guide_term}.

.Who is this {guide_term} for?
****
In the context of this guide, a _developer_ is someone who works to modify the codebase or extend the capacities of {product_suite_name}.
Some of the material in {guide_term} overlaps with the {docpro_guide_link} and/or the {admin_guide_link}.

As a developer contributing to {product_suite_name_short}, you need to understand the basic contribution workflow; plus, you should probably document your changes in the proper place and format.
Therefore, a great deal of the material in the {docpro_guide_name} is reproduced here, sometimes with modifications tailored to the developer experience.

Likewise, if you are hacking or adding to LiquiDoc, you likely need a good understanding of {product_suite_name_short} architecture and configuration, so we've included a lot of {admin_guide_name} content in this {guide_term}, as well.

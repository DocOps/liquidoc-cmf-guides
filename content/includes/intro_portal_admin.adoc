This guide exists to help you establish and maintain a complicated documentation project that essentially _treats docs source like product code_.
You will learn to configure a complex docs project in a sensible format using link:https://github.com/DocOps/liquidoc-cmf[LiquiDoc Content Management Framework] (LDCMF).
LDCMF combines the LiquiDoc open-source build utility with a set of standards and convention for organizing the codebase and proceding.

The original edition of this docset describes and instructs the management of LiquiDoc itself; as the administrator of a distinct product's documentation, you can reorient this guide to suit your needs in _two key ways_.

Customize for your docs::
Content in these docs oriented toward “documentarians” instructs the use of LDCMF, the platform your docs team now uses.
Make a few adjustments to suit your instance, and -- _voila!_ -- and your own internal documentation instructions are bootstrapped.

Customize for your dev team::
The developer-oriented documents in this guide, which instruct how to develop _LiquiDoc and LDCMF itself_, can be replaced with style guides, workflow documents, and other resources oriented to _your team's actual environment_.

Customize for your product::
What you will actually find in this repository is a docset that instructs

You are in fact encouraged to modify a fork/clone of this repository such that it fits your own product.
See the <<adapting-these-docs#,complete guide to adapting these docs to your project>>.

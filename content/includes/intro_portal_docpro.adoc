This {portal_term} is intended to orient you to the role of *documentarian*, a LiquiDoc user mainly concerned with _creating and managing content_.
This {portal_term} expects that you have a pre-configured LiquiDoc CMF environment established by a qualified engineer, and you just need to get up and running so you can write/edit content.
Hopefully, whoever did that configuring has edited this documentation in key areas to ensure it applies to your instance.

[TIP]
Check with your LiquiDoc CMF administrator to ensure this guide is oriented toward your LDCMF instance; then maybe remind them to remove this note.

Here are the user operations covered in this guide:

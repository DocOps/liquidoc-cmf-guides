There are several major differences between an open-source docs-as-code approach to creating, managing, and publishing technical documentation.
Whether they are _pros_ or _cons_ in your book may depend very much on whether your background.

Some assembly required::
Users are expected to heavily customize and extend their LDCMF environment rather than fall back on “turnkey” features and elements.
While you can technically write and build a pretty straightforward docset based on existing, freely available LDCMF examples, your needs will almost certainly vary.
The free-and-open model adhered to by the _framework_ means you will never encounter a dead end imposed by the LDCMF platform.
Hopefully you won't need to actually _modify or extend_ the base tooling to solve your needs, but you will need to _configure_ a complex docs build if you have complex problems.
Presumably, that's how you ended up here anyway.

Small data is simple::
LDCMF's sources of data and content are far simpler than conventional CMS applications.
Stored in flat files and directories rather than relational databases (RDBs), LDCMF's relatively flexible and casual datasource options have their limitations.
Most conventional CMS platforms take advantage of RDBs’ powerful indexing and querying capabilities, not only handling _content and data_ but managing large amounts of site and content _metadata_.
On the other hand, RDBs cannot be used with distributed source-control systems like Git.

GUI? What GUI?::
LiquiDoc CMF's user interface is command-line tools (CLIs) and free, open-source text/code editors, rather than proprietary desktop programs or web apps.
For some, this is the epitome of power and freedom.
For others, these blinking-cursor options are intimidating to the point of paralysis.
While LDCMF can be deftly operated by _beginners_ with both kinds of tools, there may be some initial discomfort.
But then: _total freedom and power!_

This table compares LiquiDoc CMF to leading packages of the two competing types: *content management systems* and *component content management systems*.
Shaded cells indicate one or two solutions have a distinct advantage in the category.

|===
^| Issue / Feature
^| LiquiDoc CMF
^| Conventional CMS
^| Conventional CCMS

| Extensibility
| LDCMF is open but with a limited API for now
{set:cellbgcolor:lightgray}
| FOSS CMS platforms can be readily extended
| CCMS tools heavily restrict customization
{set:cellbgcolor!}

| Interface
| Command line utilities and FOSS code editors
| Typically a web browser GUI
| Either a desktop or browser GUI

| Single-sourcing
| Code can be drawn directly from product and product-friendly datasources
{set:cellbgcolor:lightgray}
| Almost all product info duplicated in CMS; very little “component”pass:[*] support
{set:cellbgcolor!}
| Content reuse within docs source, but little crossover to product source

| Pricing
| Free as in _free af_!
{set:cellbgcolor:lightgray}
| Most of the best CMS packages are free and open source
| Most CCMS packages are expensive, licensing by the user (“seat”)
{set:cellbgcolor!}

| Source control
| Fully integrated with (& dependent on) Git
{set:cellbgcolor:lightgray}
| No product or Git integration
{set:cellbgcolor!}
| Usually mixed; rarely integrated with product code

| I18n
| No built-in internationalization support
| Often sophisticated internationalization
{set:cellbgcolor:lightgray}
| Often sophisticated internationalization

| Document search
{set:cellbgcolor!}
| Limited to basic text search
| Often sophisticated search
{set:cellbgcolor:lightgray}
| Often sophisticated search

| Source portability
{set:cellbgcolor!}
| Core aim; no need to export, simple conversions
{set:cellbgcolor:lightgray}
| Usually exports well; market saturation helpful here
| Good luck, friend
{set:cellbgcolor!}

| Web portability
| Take your static site anywhere!
{set:cellbgcolor:lightgray}
| Strict hosting reqs; devops/sysadmins cringe
{set:cellbgcolor!}
| Depends on package

| Data sources
| Flat files, mainly YAML
| Relational database (RDB)
| RDB or flat files, mainly XML

| Git Compatible
| By design!
| Nope
| Sometimes, usually as afterthought

| Content sources
| AsciiDoc in flat files
| XML or LML** in relational database (RDB)
| XML or LML, usually RDB, sometimes flat files

pass:[*] The term _component_ is a key differentiator for a CCMS, as well as for LiquiDoc CMF.
It refers to breaking content down to sensible, reusable items that can be readily _embedded_ or _cross-referenced_ wherever needed without duplicating canonical information in the source.

pass:[**] LML is lightweight markup, in this case usually non-dynamic formats like Markdown or one of the wiki-oriented markups.

include::{topic_page_meta}[tags="source-management"]

Understanding the architecture of any file- or content-management scheme takes time.
Clarity and accessibility are aided by the strict use of conventions and standards shared _team-wide_.

So that you can *find content and data* when you need it, and so you can *determine where to save new content* as you create it, we offer LiquiDoc CMF's content and file management conventions.
These are the rules governing how and where to store content and data of various types.

.Admin Note
This is a key place for custom instructions.
You will doubtless establish various data and even content types as you build, and you may prefer to drop some of the features described as standard LiquiDoc CMF conventions.
Review these instructions carefully and make edits as you see fit.

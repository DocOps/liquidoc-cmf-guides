Jekyll uses Liquid templates for page structure and for generating elements such as nav menus.
Liquid templates enable data iteration (looping), conditional flows (including switches), variables with transformation (filtering).

Jekyll's particular (modified) implementation of Liquid's templating system is covered in the link:https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/[Jekyll docs].
The official link:https://github.com/shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers[Liquid for Designers wiki] is very good, but the link:https://shopify.github.io/liquid/[official Liquid manual] is also helpful.

Liquid templates in the `theme/<theme>/_layouts/` and `theme/<theme>/_includes` directories can draw on data from any YAML files in the `data/` directory.
These variable names are structured as: `site.data.<datafile>.<varpath>.<varname>`, where <datafile> is the name of the file in the `data/` directory, where `<varpath>` is any further hierarchy inside which our intended variable is nested, and where `<varname>` is our final key.

Unlike with content/data <<prebuilding-strategy,prebuilding>>, Jekyll theme processing data must be sourced in YAML only.
It can contain strings, numerals, arrays, and structs.
The latter data types apply hierarchical nesting, as they imply subordinate data.

[NOTE]
Also unlike with content/data prebuilding, layout and include templates all have a `.html` file extension but are called merely using their extensionless filename.

During LiquiDoc build procedures, the data directory used will be `_build/data/`.
This will contain the migrated contents of the root `data/` dir as well as prebuilt YAML files, all centrally located for Jekyll ingest.

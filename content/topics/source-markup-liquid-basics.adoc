LiquiDoc CMF *_administrators_* will likely spend considerable time wading through Liquid template files, either to _generate_ (1) layout, structural, and metadata elements of the _website_ or (2) iterative elements of the _content_ (prebuilding).
In each case, templating serves the purpose of mixing small data and <<source-markup-variables-tokens#,_tokenized_>> markup, substituting _parameterized_ data for embedded tokens.

Liquid is a fairly light, tag-based markup format that enables conditional flows, iteration/looping, and powerful variable substitution.

.Example -- Conditionally looping variables in Liquid
[source,liquid]
----
{% for p in pages %}
{% if p.categories contains "tutorials" %}
<li><a href="{{ p.url }}">{{ p.title }}</a></li>
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

We'll delve deeper into Liquid later on (see <<{XREF_theming-jekyll-liquid}>>), but it is probably already becoming clear that we need to get all these different kinds of variables under control.

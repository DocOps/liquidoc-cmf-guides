# USER STORIES: These "user stories" are stated strictly from a documentation perspective. They may not
# reflect a 1:1 relationship with product user stories. When creating your own, consider the scale of a
# user story to be a distinct problem the user can resolve with a distinct action or set of steps.
# User stories always represent topics, so their slugs align with filenames in the content/topics
# directory and appears on an automatically generated HTML page of its own, unless otherwise
# instructed indicated with a setting standalone: false. Both standalone and non-standalone topic files
# can of course be included in larger files, such as pages.

topics:
# DOCPRO stories
# META-INSTRUCTIONS: You may wish to keep this entire section, though you are welcome
# to remove any story you do not wish your documentarian users to know about.

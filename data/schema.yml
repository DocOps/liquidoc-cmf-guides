# THE LDCMF USER GUIDES

# USER STORIES: These "user stories" are stated strictly from a documentation perspective. They may not
#  reflect a 1:1 relationship with product user stories. When creating your own, consider the scale of a
#  user story to be a distinct problem the user can resolve with a distinct resource or instruction.
# User stories always represent topics, so their slugs align with filenames in the content/topics
#  directory and appear on an automatically generated HTML page of its own, unless otherwise
#  instructed indicated with a setting standalone: false. Both standalone and non-standalone topic files
#  can of course be included in larger files, such as pages.

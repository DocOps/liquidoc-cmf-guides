[TIP]
--
The content above appears in all editions, but some of it is variable.
Many of the strings (e.g., _{portal_product}_ and even _{user_verb}_, etc) are variables (`\{portal_product}` and `\{user_verb}`) are dynamically substituted with AsciiDoc attributes at build time.
The content is included from a common file, like so:

[source,asciidoc]
 include::includes/intro_portal_common.adoc[]
--
endif::cheat[]

// include intro text specific to current portal
include::includes/intro_portal_{portal_slug}.adoc[]

ifdef::cheat[]
[TIP]
--
The above text is from a dynamically included file using:

[source,asciidoc]
 include::portal/intro_portal_{portal_slug}.adoc[]

Where `\{portal_slug}` is a variable defined in a block of a YAML file (`_configs/portals.yml`) that is only passed to one designated portal during the build config file (`_configs/build-docs.yml`), where it is designated as `data: data/portals.yml:portal-{portal_id}`.
